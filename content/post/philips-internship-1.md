# My First Internship at Philips

During my second year at **SintLucas Creative Technology**, I had the opportunity to join Philips for my first internship. My goal was to orient myself and explore potential career paths in the tech industry.

## Front-End for Ultrasonic Device

At Philips, I contributed to the development of a front-end interface for an ultrasonic medical device. My work focused on creating an interactive demonstration that guided users on how to position the device for optimal contact with patients, enhancing both usability and effectiveness.

## Captain Planet Game

Additionally, I collaborated with another intern on a project called **Captain Planet**â€”a game designed to encourage environmental responsibility. My role involved designing several 3D assets, including various representations of Earth in different ecological states, such as a planet affected by global warming.

This experience allowed me to combine my creative and technical skills while working on projects with real-world impact.
