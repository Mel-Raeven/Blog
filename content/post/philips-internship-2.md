# My Second Internship at Philips

For my second internship at Philips, I developed a migration tool to export users from a legacy system to a new, scalable platform.

## Migrating Users to a Serverless AWS Application

The original system was a monolithic full stack application, created by researchers to test a product. As the product needed to scale to support a much larger audience (approximately 1 million users), the application was rebuilt in AWS as a serverless solution.

The legacy application contained a few hundred users who needed to be migrated to the new system. To accomplish this, I created a migration script that transferred all user data efficiently and reliably.

## Learning and Achievements

During this internship, I gained valuable experience working with AWS services such as **DynamoDB** and **CloudFront**. The migration script successfully transferred every user, and the team was very satisfied with the results.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of cloud infrastructure and large-scale application migration.
